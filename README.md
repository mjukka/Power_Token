# Power_Token
ERC20 Token creation with Brownie and Python

In this project an ERC20 token is created with the help of OpenZeppelin contracts regarding ERC20.

There is a script implemented that deploys the token and a script to mint or burn tokens.
Also, a script of tests is included for basic testing of the contract functions.
Mock contract is used in contracts/tests to deploy in a local blockchain.
